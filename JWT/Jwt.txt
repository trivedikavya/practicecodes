PURE ENGLISH 
🔑 JWT (JSON Web Token) – Beginner-Friendly Explanation

JWTs are mainly used for Authentication (who you are) and Authorization (what you can access).
They’re lightweight, stateless tokens that the server gives to the client after login.

📦 Structure of JWT

A JWT has 3 parts separated by .:

xxxxx.yyyyy.zzzzz


Header

Contains info about the type of token (JWT) and signing algorithm (e.g., HS256).

{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}


Payload (Claims)

Stores data about the user (not the full database, just important fields).

Common claims:

sub: user id (unique identifier)

iat: issued at

exp: expiry time

custom fields: role, email, etc.

{
  "sub": "12345",
  "name": "Kavya",
  "role": "admin",
  "iat": 1734724893,
  "exp": 1734728493
}


Signature

Created using:

HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secretKey
)


Ensures the token hasn’t been tampered with.

The secret key is only known to the server.

🔐 Authentication vs Authorization

Authentication → Login/Register (Who are you?).

Authorization → After login, check if you have permission (What can you do?).

Example:

User logs in → server gives a JWT.

User requests /dashboard → JWT is valid, access granted.

User requests /admin-panel → JWT checked → if role = admin, allow; else deny.

🏪 Storage

LocalStorage / SessionStorage → Easier but less secure.

HTTP-only cookies → More secure (can’t be read by JS).

🔄 Refresh Tokens

Access tokens = short-lived (e.g., 15 mins).

Refresh tokens = long-lived (e.g., 7 days).

If access token expires → client sends refresh token → server issues new access token.

Protects against someone stealing your access token.

🆚 JWT vs Session

JWT:

Server doesn’t store session.

Token itself carries data (stateless).

Scales better for microservices / APIs.

Sessions:

Server stores user session in memory/db.

Client stores only session id (cookie).

More traditional, secure but less scalable.

✅ So your explanation is mostly right, but:

Payload doesn’t store the full database, just claims/metadata.

Signature uses the server’s secret key, not a "unique id of data".

Refresh token flow = server reissues tokens, not automatic restore.
